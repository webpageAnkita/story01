	<p>Good morning everyone.Today I would like to pick the 4th  picture .In this picture I can see that one middle aged girl is sitting on the floor and one middle aged boy is staring at her .</p>

			<p>The girl's name is Antara and the boy's name is Ayush. From her childhood Antara is a very soft-hearted women.She is not a very talkative women.She is a very good singer.Four years ago she was going to a music program and she performed a song ,and Rahul was helping her in tobla.This was their first interaction and they became very good friends.Antara who does not talk more ,started talking with Rahul almost all the time .After 3 years ,One day they decided to get married and they told it to their parents.Their parents was also very happy to see their relationship. So, both of their parents fixed a date for their wedding.</P>
			<p>Everything was going well. But at the day of their wedding Rahul died in a car accident.Antara couldn't accept it anymore .She get a shock from this incident.And she doesn't talk with anyone and she lock her in her room .She doesn't allow anyone ,not even her parents to enter in her room.She also stopped her singing . All the time she was sitting alone in the dark room.She became depressed.</p>
				  
				  <p>Her parents cann't tolerate her condition and they told the whole story to one of her good school friend Ayush.So in this picture we can see that Ayush is staring at her from the window . And with the opening of the window her dark room is filled with light .</p>
				  		 
				  		<p> Actually this picture means that not only her room become lightened with the opening of the window by  Rahul,actually Ayush come to her life to give lights to her life.</p>
